# 🌐 NativeSpark AI – AI-Based Language Learning Platform

NativeSpark AI is an **AI-powered language learning platform** designed to teach users new languages **using their mother tongue** as the primary medium of instruction. The platform focuses on inclusivity, clarity, and accessibility by combining **AI, speech technologies, and adaptive learning techniques**.

This project is developed as a **Final Year Project** and demonstrates real-world application of **AI, NLP, Web Technologies, and Full-Stack Development**.
